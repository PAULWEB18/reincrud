= Introduction =

reinCRUD is built using maven2, so all you need is a [http://maven.apache.org/ maven2] installation.


= Compiling =

There are currently two projects:
  * reincrud
  * reincrudexample

If you would like to hack on reinCRUD, you should build both projects. Do the following:

{{{
mkdir workspace
cd workspace
svn co https://acoveo.com/svnroot/business/public/trunk/reincrud
svn co https://acoveo.com/svnroot/business/public/trunk/reincrudexample
cd reincrud
mvn eclipse:eclipse
cd ../reincrudexample
mvn eclipse:eclipse
}}}

Now fire-up an eclipse installation with the WTP plugin installed, specify the workspace directory you have just created as the workspace and import the two projects (choose _Existing projects into workspace_).

Define a new tomcat 6 instance, copy the [http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/mysql/mysql-connector-java/5.1.13/mysql-connector-java-5.1.13.jar mysql-connector-java-5.1.13-bin.jar] into the _lib_ directory of your tomcat installation and have a look at _reincrudexample/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml_ which explains how to setup your JNDI datasource. Remember that the server.xml is in the _Servers_ project within the eclipse workspace!
